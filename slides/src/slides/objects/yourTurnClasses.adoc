== Your turn

Open `Classes.kt` and remove `Workshop.java` and create Kotlin equivalent

== Simplify With

`with` is a non-extension function that can access members of its argument concisely


[NOTE.speaker]
--
with(workshop) {
    return "Hello to $attendeesCount attendees of $name workshop"
}
--

== Destructuring

Data class allow destructuring calls

[NOTE.speaker]
--
fun helloWorkshop(workshop: Workshop): String {
    val (name, count) = workshop;
    return "Hello to $attendeesCount attendees of $name workshop"
}
